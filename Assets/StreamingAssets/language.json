    "Level1Line4": "Let's start with the basics. <color=#FFDD00>Newton's Third Law of Motion refers to the principle that every action has an equal and opposite reaction.</color> ",
    "Level1Line5": "In other words, <color=#FFDD00>for every force exerted on an object, there is an equal and opposite force exerted back on the object. </color>",

    "Level3Line4": "<color=#FFDD00>Did you know that Newton's Third Law also applies to the fuel used in spacecraft? When fuel is burned, gases are expelled backward, creating a force that propels the spacecraft forward. It's like a controlled explosion!</color> ",
    "Level3Line5": "If you run out of <color=#DD00FF>gas</color> then you wont be able to use your thrusters. <color=#FFDD00>No propulsion force means no opposing force, you won't be able to control your ship!</color>",

    "Level4Line3": "Pilots can calculate how their actions will affect the movement of the spacecraft and plan accordingly.</color>",
    "Level4Line4": "For your last planet-based exercise <color=#DD00FF>try to collect as many coins as you can and land safely back on the landing pad.</color>",
    "Level4Line5": "If you can get this exercise right then we can start your proper missions in space!",

    "Level5Line2": "<color=#FFDD00>Did you know astronauts have to wear special suits during spacewalks because of Newton's Third Law? </color>",
    "Level5Line3": "<color=#FFDD00>When they use their hands or legs to push off objects in space, the force can push them away too. The suits have small jets that help them control their movements.</color>",

    "Level5Line5": "They Didn't study up on <color=#FFDD00>Newton's Third Law of Motion</color> and now they are floating around somewhere in space!",

    "Level6Line5": "<color=#FFDD00>It's like a cosmic game of catch! We'll both experience those equal and opposite reactions as we toss things around in space.</color>",
    "Level6Line6": "Remember, even something as simple as throwing a balloon can have fascinating consequences in zero gravity, all because of <color=#FFDD00>Newton's Third Law!</color>",
