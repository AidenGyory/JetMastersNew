    "Level1Line1": "Welcome to the space program Cadet! I will be your Instructor before you get into orbit! ",
    "Level1Line2": "Every space cadet needs to start on the basics before they get their Space Wings! That's what I'm here to teach you! ",
    "Level1Line3": "It's super important for <color=#F9DD3B>astronauts</color> to know their Physics! How's your Newton's Third law of Motion? ",
    "Level1Line4": "Let's start with the basics. <color=#F9DD3B>Newton's Third Law of Motion</color> refers to the principle that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. ",
    "Level1Line5": "In other words, for every force exerted on an object, there is an equal and opposite force exerted back on the object. ",
    "Level1Line6": "Let's see an example of this in action! Use the <color=#F9DD3B>LAUNCH</color> button to try and collect the token and land safely back on the landing pad! ",
    "Level2NPC": "CADET INSTRUCTOR",
    "Level2Line1": "Well done Cadet! you are well on your way to getting those Space Wings! ",
    "Level2Line2": "This lesson is all about Manoeuvring. I'll teach you how to move your spaceship around not just go up and down! ",
    "Level2Line3": "Did you know that just like the force exerted to launch us into the air, a similar force can be applied to the side of your spaceship to make it turn? ",
    "Level2Line4": "Use your <color=#F9DD3B>Side Thrusters</color> to turn the spaceship in mid-air and land on the landing pad over to the right. ",
    "Level2Line5": "As you can see your Locator will show you where the Landing Pad is.",
    "Level2Line6": "Oh and if you collect all 3 coins I'll give you 3 stars for completing this mission! ",
    "Level3NPC": "STAR COMMANDER",
    "Level3Line1": "Great work Cadet! Your instructor has told me a lot about your progress! ",
    "Level3Line2": "If you keep going the way you are going you will be one of our top pilots in no time! ",
    "Level3Line3": "Now, i know its a lot of fun to pilot your spaceship but you need to keep a watchful eye on your <color=#F9DD3B>gas...</color> ",
    "Level3Line4": "Did you know that Newton's Third Law also applies to the fuel used in spacecraft? When fuel is burned, gases are expelled backward, creating a force that propels the spacecraft forward. It's like a controlled explosion!",
    "Level3Line5": "If you run out of <color=#F9DD3B>gas</color> then you wont be able to use your thrusters. No propulsion force means no opposing force, you won't be able to control your ship!",
    "Level3Line6": "Try to collect the coins and land on the Landing Pad without running out of <color=#F9DD3B>gas!</color>",
    "Level4NPC": "STAR COMMANDER",
    "Level4Line1": "It looks like the Cadet Instructor has taught you well! I think you might just be ready to get your Space Wings... ",
    "Level4Line2": "Understanding Newton's Third Law helps spacecraft pilots make precise maneuvers by considering the equal and opposite forces involved. ",
    "Level4Line3": "Pilots can calculate how their actions will affect the movement of the spacecraft and plan accordingly.",
    "Level4Line4": "For your last planet-based exercise try to collect as many coins as you can and land safely back on the landing pad.",
    "Level4Line5": "If you can get this exercise right then we can start your proper missions in space!",
    "Level5NPC": "STAR COMMANDER",
    "Level5Line1": "Congratulations Cadet! You've successfully graduated and received your Space Wings!",
    "Level5Line2": "Did you know Astronauts have to wear special suits during spacewalks because of Newton's Third Law? ",
    "Level5Line3": "When they use their hands or legs to push off objects in space, the force can push them away too. The suits have small jets that help them control their movements.",
    "Level5Line4": "For your first space mission We need you to rescue our Communications Officer.",
    "Level5Line5": "They Didn't study up on Newton's Third Law and now they are floating around somewhere in space!",
    "Level5Line6": "Remember that your locator can help you find your objectives.",
    "Level6NPC": "COMMS OFFICER",
    "Level6Line1": "Thanks so much for saving me! I could have been floating around forever!",
    "Level6Line2": "Since your last mission I've been brushing up on my Newton's Third Law of Motion. ",
    "Level6Line3": "According to Newton's Third Law, as I throw the balloon forward, I'll experience an equal and opposite reaction backward.",
    "Level6Line4": "So, while the balloon zooms towards you, pushing you backward, I'll find myself drifting in the opposite direction, thanks to the force of the balloon pushing me backward.",
    "Level6Line5": "It's like a cosmic game of catch! We'll both experience those equal and opposite reactions as we toss things around in space.",
    "Level6Line6": "Remember, even something as simple as throwing a balloon can have fascinating consequences in zero gravity, all because of Newton's Third Law!",
    "Level6Line7": "So, next time we're floating in space together, let's have a balloon-throwing competition and see who can maneuver the most gracefully! Sound like fun?",
